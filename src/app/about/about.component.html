            Since I was young I had ever been the most popular guy in the class neither the smartest or the fittest. Indeed, during my school I suffered from bullying as I was a fat guy with classes who was studying all day. Or that is what they thing. I was not
            just a hard-working guy, I was also getting enough information in order to transform the world.

            All my childhood has been influenced by my aunt. She had suffered twice from breast cancer, once from tyroid cancer and right now, in 2020, she is undergoing stage IV metastatic lung cancer. Her lungs look like a cake full of small and destructive chocolate
            bombs. She is my superhero is only one of the more than 8 million superheroes that struggle against cancer every year. I was more focused on what I could do to save her rather than taking care of myself.

            For that reason, when I was 15 I started my first project at the same time I got tired of my 9-2 school journey without having a real impact on her life and the life of others. At that same time Google released Tensorflow libraries and I decided to make
            use of my gained expertised in cancer and my understanding on programming in order to make something big. This initial project lately became Biop AI after 3 years. Biop AI is a UK-based company which makes usage of artificial intelligence
            for the early-stage cancer diagnosis. Our first product focuses on suspicious bad-moles diagnosis versus the healthy ones and is currently under clinical trials.

            Furthermore, I also co-founded another company in Spain called Nutrilieve for developing personalized diets to oncologic patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The idea with it is to palliate side-effects through the diet.

            Looks cool right? Definitely. It is not cool just because I am fulfilling an inner passion but because it allows me to be HAPPY. Exactly, how many millions do you want in your bank account if you are not happy? Trading? Dropshipping?

            What if I told you that you will be rich if you pursue your dreams instead of pursuing society dreams?
